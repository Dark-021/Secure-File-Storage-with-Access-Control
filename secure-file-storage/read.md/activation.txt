STEP 1 — Activate virtual environment

You need to enable Python’s virtual environment each time you start fresh.
If PowerShell gives you the “execution policy” error again, just run this once in that session:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

Then activate the venv:

.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
✅ You should see (venv) appear at the start of your command prompt.

🟢 STEP 2 — Start MongoDB

If MongoDB is installed as a Windows Service, start it with:
net start MongoDB
If you installed it manually (no service), you can start it from its install directory like:

"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\7.0\bin\mongod.exe"
Leave that running in the background (it’s your database).

🟢 STEP 3 — Start MinIO (for file storage)

Open another PowerShell window and run:
cd C:\minio
.\minio.exe server C:\minio\data --console-address ":9001"


✅ You should see:

API: http://127.0.0.1:9000
Console: http://127.0.0.1:9001

Keep this window open.

🟢 STEP 4 — Run your Flask backend

Back in your first terminal (with venv active):
(venv) C:\Users\zaid\projects\secure-file-storage\server> python app.py


✅ You should see something like:

 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Keep this running too — it’s your backend API.

🟢 STEP 5 — Open your frontend

Now open your web browser (e.g., Brave, Chrome, Edge) and go to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
You should see your styled “Secure File Store” interface.

🟢 STEP 6 — Test the functionality
